# V2G OPF #

This is an optimal power flow (OPF) formulation to investigate network impacts of V2G charging. This has been developed using OATS as a joint project with Dr Waqquas Bukhsh (University of Strathclyde) originally funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) (2016-2019).
